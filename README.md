# CalorieBuddy
 
I created a simple dynamic web application with database access, routes, and forms. This project requires me to develop a new dynamic web application that will serve as a virtual calorie counter to aid users in managing their diet. Essentially, users can interact with the dynamic web application to calculate and display nutritional information, including calories, for their recipes or meals based on the food ingredients in the recipe or meal. The option to include nutritional information for food ingredients should be given to the user, allowing them store it in the database.

Based on the food ingredients that the user has chosen to include in the recipe or meal, the web application should show users the total number of calories for that recipe or meal. As an illustration, the user should be able to choose the food ingredients for the recipe for "apple pie" by selecting "flour," "egg," "butter," "brown sugar," and "apple," and then the web application should retrieve the nutritional facts for each food ingredient and calculate and display the nutritional facts, including calorie count, of the "apple pie" recipe. If a food ingredient is missing from the database, the user should have the option of adding it.
