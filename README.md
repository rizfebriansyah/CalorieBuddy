# CalorieBuddy
 
I created a simple dynamic web application with database access, routes, and forms. This project requires me to develop a new dynamic web application that will serve as a virtual calorie counter to aid users in managing their diet. Essentially, users can interact with the dynamic web application to calculate and display nutritional information, including calories, for their recipes or meals based on the food ingredients in the recipe or meal. The option to include nutritional information for food ingredients should be given to the user.
